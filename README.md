# app-academy-html-form
This little project is part of the App Academy Open Full-Stack progression. The focus is HTML forms. It comprises a basic survey form for the students and faculty of a/A to find out what their favorite programming language is, with any additional comments they would like to submit. Initially, there will be neither CSS styling nor Javascript interactivity.
